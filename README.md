# Facebook User Engagement Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed user engagement metrics from a dataset of Facebook users to understand various patterns and trends. The main objectives were to:

### 1. Comprehensively Overview User Engagement Metrics

- Calculate average likes, friend counts, and friendships initiated across users.
- Assess how these metrics are distributed based on gender.
- Examine engagement patterns by the device used (mobile vs. web).

### 2. Identify Top-Performing Users

- Determine users with the highest likes received.
- Identify users who initiated the most friendships.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Comprehensive Overview of User Engagement Metrics

- **Grouping by User ID and Tenure**: 
  - I grouped user data by user ID and tenure to calculate the average likes, friend counts, and friendships initiated. This allowed me to understand the engagement levels of users based on their duration on the platform.
- **Gender-Based Analysis**: 
  - By grouping data by gender, I could compare the total likes, friend counts, and friendships initiated between male and female users, revealing any gender-based engagement differences.

### 2. Engagement Patterns by Device Used

- **Device-Based Analysis**: 
  - I compared the number of likes and likes received on mobile devices versus web platforms, segmented by gender. This analysis helped identify which platform had higher engagement for different genders.

### 3. Platform Engagement Summary

- **Platform-Based Summary**: 
  - I summarized engagement metrics based on the platform (mobile vs. web), providing insights into user behavior and preferences for different devices.

### 4. Top-Performing Users

- **Identifying Influential Users**: 
  - I identified the top 10 users with the highest likes received and the most friendships initiated, showcasing the most influential and active users on the platform.

## Aim and Achievement
